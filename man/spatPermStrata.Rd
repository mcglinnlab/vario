\title{Permute an array of occurances under a given set of constraints in
2-dimensions of space with defined spatial strata, see 'nstrata'}
\usage{
spatPermStrata(
  psp,
  shiftpos = NULL,
  rotate = NULL,
  meth = "shift",
  sp = FALSE,
  nstrata = 1
)
}
\arguments{
\item{psp}{the sp x row x col array, where rows and columns specify where on 
the spatial grid the sample was located}

\item{shiftpos:}{two numbers that are the x and y places to shift the grid,
this is generated randomly if needed}

\item{rotate:}{a single number 1-4 that indicates how many counterclockwise 
rotations to perform, generated randomly}

\item{meth:}{the type of permutation to use, options include: 1) reflect:
random reflection/rotations of species (only makes sence when sp are not
fixed 2) shift: random torodial shifting with or with sp fixed 3) both:
both reflection and shifting 4) random: random shuffle}

\item{sp:}{if FALSE then obs composition of quadrats is fixed to the observed
pattern if TRUE then species are each shuffled independently}

\item{nstrata:}{is the number of strata along a single spatial axis within
which to randomize}
}
